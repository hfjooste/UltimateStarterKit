## Requirements
It's important that you configure the settings in the <a href="/gameinstance">Game Instance</a> before you can use the settings feature

## Controls Settings
Before you can use the plugin to automatically handle the controls settings, you need to configure your Input Mapping Context. You are required to specify the `Name` for each key that can be changed through the plugin. This `Name` should match the value you specify in your `Menu Item`<br/><br/>
<i><strong>NB: This feature is only available on Unreal Engine 5 and newer (UE5.3 support coming soon)</strong></i>
